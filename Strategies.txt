this is the strategies design document,
different strategies include:
--agent team forming Strategy (first round)
--agent in round strategies:
    AoS selection
    gameplay:
        roll
        contribute
        take
    audit
    AoS modify
--articles of association (AoS)
    expected contribution
    common pool assignment rules
    audit rules
        resource expent
        what happen to agent fail

--team reforming after (later rounds) (optional)






agent gameplay stragies: SEE FLOWCHART agentstrate.drawio

how the differnet specterms in the flowchart to be implemented

    roll(satisfied number):
        stick or reroll
        behavior is decided by the desire to reroll to a better score ()
        greedy: >12, balanced 12-8, safe: 8-6

    contribute(threshold, policy):
        how much to put on the common pool, behavior is decided by the threshold and the current policy 
        greedy: ignore policy

    take(threshold,policy,common_pool_size ):
        how much to take from the coomon pool 

    audit(audit_cost, audit_consequence,expected_pool_size, current_pool_size, other_people's_resource, who_started_audit,who_hasn't_been audited)
        when to audit and who to audit (can get very complicated)


AOA selection stragies:
    rank the proposed rules by their parameters and our preset strategies ( can we give everyone else 0s?)
    what are the parameters and their specterems?

    AOA(expected contribution, requirements to take, audit_cost, audit_consequence)


    we have our own 


    Audit Steps:

    One Agent choose another agent to audit, people vote whether we audit that agent. 

    Audit meets an majority to go through, we spend public pool resource.

    The God would tell if a guy is lying or not (I don't like this part), if he lies, he gets penalty

    if the person gets audited is not lying, then the person starting the audit gets some penalty?

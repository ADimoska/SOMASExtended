Game Rules:
Server decides on N rounds and T: - We can decide if T is known by the agents and whether T will change.

Team Formation: 
-	Either agree to form teams before hand and hard code. (Teams are then fixed)
-	Randomise some clustering of agents to form teams.
-	Have some form of grid acting like a ‘map’ agents are arbitrarily moved a random distance, if they’re within a team they are considered 1 entity and agents can decide whether to join a team.

Once teams are formed:
-	Server goes through each team and starts a vote on strategy (and audit strategy?)
-	Or have audit fixed.

Round Start:
-	Server iterates through each team.
-	Within team, agent rolls dice and decides whether to stick, reroll, contribute etc.
-	After each agent in the team has broadcasted finish actions, server moves on to next team.
-	After gone through all teams: server broadcasts and kills players below threshold. 




Agent:
Vote() – takes in Type of Vote (Strategy or Audit), teamID
GetTeam() – Returns TeamID of team
BroadcastFinish()
DecideAction() -> Returns amount contributed /broadcasts it + amount, includes rolling rerolling etc. 
ProposeAudit()



Server:
Form_Team() :
-	 Returns a list of teams.
-	Calls function that handles voting/strategy within each team.
-	Assigns each agent to a team.
